# Pi-Hue

Pi-Hue is a quick Flask app to throw on a Raspberry Pi that lets you interface with Philips Hue's API. Let's start quick-n-dirty and refine as we go.

## Why are bothering with the Raspberry Pi?

It lets everybody on your network mess with your lights. I will probably add some authentication but at the moment it's not a concern. There are more fun things to tackle first.

## Why else though?

Because I'd like to leverage my Pi's camera to get the outside color temperature, and adjust the lights accordingly.

## Anything else you'd like to tell us?

This is my first foray into the IoT. This is a tech space that I really enjoy and would love to do more in.
